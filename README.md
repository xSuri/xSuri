My name is Hubert. He has been programming since about the 5th / 6th grade of primary school. I have had extensive experience with computer science and electronics since I was a child. I started programming with C++, but my heart was mainly captured by JavaScript -> nodejs (BE) + react (FE). I can also write in other languages such as python, operate databases and so on. I am also interested in pentesting and cybersecurity, which is what I would like to pursue in my professional future.

I am currently studying to become a programming technician. Exam inf. 03 and inf. 04 I passed, which results in the title of Programming Technician. I also have a driving license.

I could tell you more in a direct conversation. Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I have always been an honest and self-controlled person, although sometimes he can "positive ignite" or slightly upset me. I've had a lot of good and bad moments in my life, so I can be empathetic and try to talk to people. I am quite an unsure person and I am working on it all the time. He mainly speaks English and Polish and sometimes German. Is are many more things "about me", but I tell you in private :D. 

Thanks for your time!
