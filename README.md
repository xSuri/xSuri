# a few info about me


My name is Hubert and since childhood I have been interested in and have had contact with generally understood computer science, electronics, etc.

My main interests are programming (I've learned most of the languages starting with C ++, but as of today I'm in love with javascript), cybersecurity, and pentests / redteam. I also know the databases that I use myself (MYSQL, etc.). I now program in js mainly in the nodejs library.

I would like to develop mainly towards cybersecure, although I do not exclude being a programmer.

In my life I have been in administration a lot and I know what it is. I remember when was afraid of my first "punishment" ... I know the basics of using the git. I made servers in games like MTA, Minecraft etc. I having been a few times cheated by other people a few times <:

I have always been an honest and self-controlled person, although sometimes he can "positive ignite" or slightly upset me. I've had a lot of good and bad moments in my life, so I can be empathetic and try to talk to people. I am quite an unsure person and I am working on it all the time. I can communicate in English on a communicative level, unless I get very angry, I can not qtell everything how I should be. I hope you got interested in me C:

Thanks for your time!
