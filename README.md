My name is Hubert. He has been programming since about the 5th / 6th grade of primary school. I have had extensive experience with computer science and electronics since I was a child. I started programming with C++, but my heart was mainly captured by JavaScript -> nodejs (BE) + react (FE). I can also write in other languages such as python and many others taught in my free time or at school. I am also interested in pentesting and cybersecurity, which is what I would like to connect my professional future with. I would most like to join the redteam.


I passed the state exams inf. 03, and inf. 04

I have the title of Programming Technician

I have a category B driving license


I have solved many CTFs and other machines on popular and less popular websites. There is no point in mentioning the courses on Udemy in detail, but they are mainly based on programming/cybersecurity -> pentests/redteam


I have always been an honest and composed person. Sometimes something can "positively fire me up" or slightly upset me, which only motivates me more. I have had many good and bad moments in my life, so I can show empathy and try to talk to people. I was shy, but I've repaired that. I speak mainly Polish, or sometimes English, and occasionally German. There are many more things "about me", but I can tell them privately :D.


I could tell you more in a direct conversation. Thanks for taking the time to read this!
